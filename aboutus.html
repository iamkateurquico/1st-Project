        <h1 class="text-center">Meet the 21-Year-Old CEO Behind Local Jewelry Line 'Tala by Kyla!</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="row text-center">
            <div class="col-md-7">
                <img src="kyla.jpeg" alt="owner" width="750" height="950">
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="col-md-3 text-center">
                <p>In May 2018, before she entered her first year of college, Kyla began Tala By Kyla (TBK) with nothing more than a dream, a loving support system, and only Php20,000 as capital. Today, TBK‚Äôs accessories are an essential part of your outfits‚Äîtheir earrings, necklaces, and rings all bring out, as the tagline of the business says, your "sparkle."</p>
                <br>
                <p>Kyla shared that she already had a knack for selling jewelry like chokers and hair clips in high school. Then, with a gentle push from her mother, who was already in the jewelry business, Kyla brought her designs to life and built TBK with her own creative vision and dreams of making ‚Äúsomething that will make someone shine.‚Äù</p>
                <br>
                <p>Of course, this didn't come without difficulties and challenges. She was a one-woman staff who managed, packed, marketed and advertised, and delivered her products to her customers. ‚ÄúDati, I only had one order a day,‚Äù Kyla shared.</p>
                <br>
                <p>And now she has a million customers following her Facebook page, and thousands on Twitter and Instagram, and she developed her own website. With this influx of customers, Kyla hired more manpower to help her pack the orders to get them delivered as quickly as possible. Today, she‚Äôs heading this business with her mom‚ÄîKyla at the front of marketing design, and her mother in charge of the internal operations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tala by Kyla is known for producing designs that speak to the interests of her audience: Disney Princesses, Haikyuu!, K-dramas and K-pop, horoscopes, and Barbie collections are just a few of the examples. When asked where she gets the inspiration for these, Kyla said that it usually comes from her own interests, but that she also listens to the interests of others. ‚ÄúThey were suggesting rin, pinapakinggan ko lang sila,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúI make sure na [the designs are] fit and connected with them.‚Äù</p>
                <br>
                <p>This CEO manages her business through conversations with her customers. On TBK‚Äôs Twitter and Instagram accounts, there‚Äôs a suggestion form linked for restocks and new design requests. Talk about excellent customer service!</p>
